# History
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use more intelligent Up/Down behavior: use the text that has already been
# typed as the prefix for searching through commands, like in Vim.

# Ensure that left and right continue to work correctly.

# Autocompletion
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Make Tab autocompletion case-insensitive (cd ~/dow<Tab> => cd ~/Downloads/).
set completion-ignore-case On

# When autocompleting symlinks to directories, immediately add a trailing "/".
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not expand "~" to the home directory when completing. (The actual value
# passed on to the command still is expanded, though. Which is good.) "Off" is
# the default value, but some servers override this, so I override the override.
set expand-tilde off

# Flip through autocompletion matches with Shift-Tab.

# Do not autocomplete hidden files ("dot files") unless the pattern explicitly
# begins with a dot.

# all.

# Show extra file information when completing, like ls -F does.
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing them like $'\0123\0456'.
